h1. Bitmasked Plugin

Row-level filtering of models via bitmasks.

h2. Requirements

* PHP5.2+ (Fully featured with 5.3+)
* CakePHP 1.3+

h2. Installation

h3. Manual

# Download this: http://github.com/jmcneese/bitmasked/zipball/master
# Unzip that download.
# Copy the resulting folder to app/plugins
# Rename the folder you just copied to @bitmasked@

h3. GIT Submodule

From your repository root directory type:
<pre><code>git submodule add git://github.com/jmcneese/bitmasked.git app/plugins/bitmasked
git submodule update --init
</code></pre>

h3. GIT Clone

In your plugin directory type
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/jmcneese/bitmasked.git</code></pre>

h2. Usage

# Import the SQL in config/schema/bitmasked_bits.sql into your application's database
# Activate the behavior in whichever model(s) you desire, via:<pre><code>
public $actsAs = array(
	'Bitmasked.Bitmasked'
);
</code></pre>

h2. Options

There are several configurable options that can be passed into the behavior:

* <em>disabled</em> -- If you want the behavior to start as disabled, i.e. not automatically filter rows based on bitmask, set this to true. Default: false
* <em>default</em> -- This is the default bit that is saved for new records for this model, unless otherwise specified in save data. Default: 1
* <em>bits</em> -- An array of flags (string) that map to bits (integer) to use for this particular model. Default: array('ALL' => 1)
* <em>mask</em> -- The bitmask to use when finding records on this model. There are several possible settings here:
** Implicit (integer). This is when the bitmask is static across all finds.
** Flag (string). This is a string representation of a flag you have defined in the 'bits' option.
** Flags (array). An array of flags in string form.
** Callback (mixed). Either a string referring to a function name in global scope, a method in the attached model or an anonymous function (PHP5.3 only).

h2. Examples



h2. Todo

* Add behavior method to reconfigure, e.g. change configuration options.
